# recursive-logit
Recursive logit model is another stochastic assginment method, which is very similar to Dial algorithm. The difference is that a logit model is used to calculate
the link choice probabilities at each node rather than a deterministic probability. similarly, the process of enumerating all effective paths can be skipped.
